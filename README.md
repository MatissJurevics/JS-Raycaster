A basic raycaster made using the cavas api. To move around the map use the arrow keys. This project was inspired by [Maksim Ivanov](https://github.com/satansdeer/raycaster). Blog post on the steps I took to make it will be available at my blog soon.

### To Do 
- Fix basic textures 
- segment project into multiple files (Kinda hard to read through nearly 400 lines of scattered code)
- Implement better texturing
- implement map creater and devtools
